### weather-app-reactjs

Last year I uploaded a full-stack weather web app using EJS for the front-end templating. This repo is a slight upgrade in the UI and UX while using coding the front-end in ReactJS to brush up on my skills. A few more components left to complete.

I am skipping redoing the back-end for this.
